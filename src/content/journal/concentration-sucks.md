summary: "My experience concentrating"

I'm an awful procrastinator. Luckily, when time starts running out, I find I can hyper-concentrate on projects. Spend hours on them. Get up and take a walk and have the only thing in my mind be what I'm working on.

But it's hard nonetheless. I can't reliably get this state and most of the time I can't even get myself to start something. Make me work on a project with a progress bar or constant feedback and I'll excel, but starting that or getting that feedback is so hard. I don't really have an answer.
