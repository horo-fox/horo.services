Disclaimer: I don't read that much; I don't know very much about these styles.

I think there's several distinct styles or effects on me that fictional books can have. Any books I mention here are super highly recommended!

1. Most books I read fall into this category. This is [_Project Hail Mary_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary) or [_Ascendence of a Bookworm_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascendance_of_a_Bookworm) or [_The Girl Who Ate Death_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-girl-who-ate-a-death-god/). The main and interesting point of these is the protagonist, their thoughts and interests, and the world's effects on them. While their effects _on the world_ can also be interesting, I don't think that's necessarily the main point.
2. This category is [_The Old Man and the Sea_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea) and [_Chronicle of a Death Foretold_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_a_Death_Foretold) (I think. It's been a while since I read this.). The interesting point of these are the world around the protagonist. I'm not actually sure if that's a correct explanation since it's been a while since I read both of these.
3. Finally, the famous (at least from what I've seen) literature. This includes [_Gravity's Rainbow_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity%27s_Rainbow) and not much else that I've read. Personally, I'm mostly interested in the wordsmithing and the language used. The plot itself feels like a puzzle which you sometimes see glimpses of. At least to me. Recommending books here is weird because I don't think most people would like them and I felt like they were slogs while reading them... But they're poignant and I actually want to reread _Gravity's Rainbow_!
