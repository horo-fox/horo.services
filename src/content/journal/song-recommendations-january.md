summary: "Music and songs I've liked recently (January edition)"

I spent my time today on homework, so that's not a source of things to talk about. I finished what I wanted to, at least.

But anyways, I've been liking some rap:

-   JPEGMafia has been growing on me
-   Quadeca has some cool stuff in the scrapyards EPs

I've also been getting back into electronic:

-   Jane Remover (I really like Frailty!)
-   some underscores
-   Getting back into Porter Robinson's Nurture

Trying out some new artists:

-   boygenius (I really like "Afraid of Heights" and "Letter To An Old Poet")
-   Hozier ("Someone New" is great!)

And some older songs:

-   Early Radiohead: "Just" and "Jigsaw Falling Into Place"
-   Classic rock: Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins

I'm going to a Jane Remover concert in February so I should get some more listening in to Census Designated. I also want to find some new electronic artists. I'm happy about the breadth of rap I like once I put time into it!
