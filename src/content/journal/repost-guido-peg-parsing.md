I didn't do much that I feel like writing about today. But I still want an entry. So here's a series I've been thinking through. Left-recursion is handled nicely in Python's `pegen` and I'm not sure if this series covers it though.

I really like this series: https://medium.com/@gvanrossum_83706/peg-parsing-series-de5d41b2ed60

He did a talk too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QppWTvh7_sI
