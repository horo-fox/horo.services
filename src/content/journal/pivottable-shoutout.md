summary: "I've used a bunch of pivot tables recently. They're great!"

I made some basic visualizations of the available rooms for next year's housing. For them, I set up a basic Excel connection to get the data, some basic expanding to get it in a table, then another basic range expression to process the data a bit. (PowerQuery is a strange language)

Once I had all the data I needed, the visualization I wanted was only a few clicks away and I got a free chart along with the table (using a pivotchart). I can refresh it at will and it just works. It's great!
