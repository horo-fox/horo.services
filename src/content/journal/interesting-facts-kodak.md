summary: "There's (2) Kodak labs in Atlanta and more"
---

I watched the Technology Connections video on flash photography earlier. After he offhandedly mentioned Ektachrome, I looked it up.

Turns out:

- Kodak runs a photography developing (?) lab in Atlanta. Here are the addresses:
  - 2156 Faulkner Road (16mm, 35mm color)
  - 6 West Druid Hills Drive (35mm color)
- Kodak had to let others develop photographs because of an antitrust ruling.

This makes me want to recreate a camera. I made one in high school as part of a class project, but I made that of wood (not necessarily bad) and it wasn't very good. I think it would be quite fun to recreate that using the maker spaces here. Might be a good excuse to try out the Hive some more? Or to visit Flowers?

Unfortunately, the development process is hard. It appears Paper & Clay might have a darkroom (to be checked) but it's for conventional film -- I'd want to use some black and white sheets because those are what I've worked with before. And my dorm room doesn't get dark enough! Might be possible to do it in the bathroom.
