I don't really get vinyls. Like it seems an inferior storage mechanism to, say, a file. I still get them from concerts though, as mementos. Currently they're stilled wrapped, though I don't know if that effects resale value.

I do like that vinyls might have extra tracks or an actual track listing or interesting dynamics around swapping the sides. I also like the art on them.

This is mostly just a filler post because I don't have much to talk about today.
