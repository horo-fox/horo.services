Georgia Tech's bus service is operated by PTS. They have this nice (?) live tracker available at https://bus.gatech.edu. It uses some proxied JSON routes that I'm not going to find right now because this is a lazy post.

But I have a scraper that seems to work. I just don't have a use for the data and didn't make the scraper very resilient to errors.
