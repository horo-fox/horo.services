title: "Making programming more interesting by adding restrictions"

summary: "Reflections on the first homework assignment in CS 2110."

I finished the homework assignment yesterday but I was struggling to think of journal entries for today so...

Basically, the first homework assignment for CS 2110 required people to submit code that accomplished a goal under a very large set of restrictions. While at first glance the assignment seemed fun, it was ultimately annoying and required quadratic runtime stuff and ugh.

But, it reminds me of how much fun it can be to code golf things. I'm going to try to introduce some people to code golfing (via some stupid rounds that are just math on some site). It should be easy enough to make a code golf platform for longer length, harder problems? Stuff like: parsing OGG files, basic computer algebra system, forming websocket frames, etc. While I think most of the problems would end up being parsing related, it might still be fun?

Starting to think about how the site would work: I think the languages should mainly be Python and Javascript. Javascript is trivial to run in the browser -- I could use pyodide for Python? I think it might actually be a really fun project to make.
