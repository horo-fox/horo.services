Hello there! I'm setting up a presence on the web!

This site uses Astro and is my attempt at something more web-ish. It uses a bunch of fun CSS techniques (shout out to the margin rules for these journal entries!). I'm not going to elaborate at length though because there's too many people doing that.

Have a nice day!
