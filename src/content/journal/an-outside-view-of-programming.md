summary: "Being a programmer, it's hard to remember what drew me"

I absolutely love programming. Recently, I've been thinking about how non-programmers view programmers, specifically in the context of what programmer-specific content would a non-programmer appreciate? This is part of a larger rethinking of myself. So here's my thoughts:

- Decompiling is interesting and fun to do, but runs into some legal barriers (as part of software contracts). Supposedly the DMCA (see what I was talking about yesterday??) sets aside a specific exclusion for interop purposes. Think liveoverflow.
- Actually making a software project. I'm not sure this is entertaining for non-software folks, unless explained well. Explaining is hard!
- Reacting to software news. This isn't entertaining to non-programmers, I think. Think Primeagen, fireship.

Looking for analogues to software engineering, I find stuff like Practical Engineering or Veritasium, who produce high quality videos explaining larger systems. I think that might be the best approach listed here.
