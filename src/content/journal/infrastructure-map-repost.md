I found [an interesting map about Georgia Tech](https://fm-gis2.ad.gatech.edu/building-utility.html) a while ago. It's interesting that most of our buildings use our own electricity except for ... Woodruff.

I'm not sure what else to add. It's cool being able to see gross square footage of buildings and interesting that the CRC and East campus dorms use entirely different heating types (steam) than West campus dorms (gas).
