summary: "They all seem overcomplicated?"

I was recently reading some legal stuff about companies and reporting requirements. Why? I have no clue. It's not useful to me and it's genuinely overcomplicated. All these 3 letter acronyms and they don't even glow!

Anyways it's been a while because it's been Spring break. I've put more thought into how I want to present things and I'm leaning towards more of a lab notebook aesthetic but I'm still not sure of the contents. I don't think CS works well enough for experiments, but maybe research questions? I could look at whitequark's some more.
