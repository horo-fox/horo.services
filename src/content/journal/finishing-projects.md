summary: "Finishing a core goal or something can be fun, but can a project be finished?"

Happy leap day! I finished a PR I worked on for probably 10 to 15 hours over the last few days, and the diff's around +10k -11k. It's mostly just copying things around and isn't completely finished yet, but I am so happy that I got this far with it.

Is it possible to have that same experience around a project? None of the projects I pick up have defined endpoints, because they can just add whatever.
