summary: "Why I made this journal, problems I've encountered, and future changes"

This journal is very much inspired by [whitequark's lab notebook](https://lab.whitequark.org/) and aims to be a record of what I learn. However, I decided that because (in past blogs) I've struggled to write anything down, I decided I wanted to write posts every day I have class (excluding Friday because I skip the one class half the time and I haven't learned much in that specific session).

I like being forced to think of ideas of what to do: I just feel like my time is too limited for it all! I'm still going to keep this journal going until the end of this semester because I wanted to, but I'm going to then archive this and then not touch this folder again. I'll need to come up with some way to make myself actually write down reports of things I do, but it will be nice not to worry about missing a day and not to have to come up with filler because I was busy with homework or reading.

Next semester and onwards, I'm going to retheme things and work in slightly different format. I want it to be more inspired by lab notebooks than this currently is, but also I want to talk about more than just computer science. I think it might be possible to just use some sort of category system where some things are "lab notebook" (how-tos for specific code things) and some things are "analysis" (reflections on things I read or learn)?

Anyways ironically I wrote this as filler today because I spent my time reading. Oops.
