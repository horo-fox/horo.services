summary: "I had to play NORCO for class and I have a few things I quite like about it"

I quite like the music and general atmosphere of the game. It feels like it takes itself a bit too seriously at times and then descends into absurdist humor elsewhere, but maybe that's just part of the atmosphere.

It took me quite a while since I was clicking all the things :'( and some of the events were somewhat unexpected. Pretty fun nonetheless, even though its not my typical game.
