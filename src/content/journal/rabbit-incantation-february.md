There's this cute incantation some people say at the start of the month ("rabbit rabbit rabbit"), though I've always had some issues remembering to say it. I managed today! And it did bring me good luck!

I got an email I was hoping to get (technically 10pm on the 31st but who's counting) and things seem possible! I also don't really have much to write about today, so yeah.
