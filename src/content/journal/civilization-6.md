summary: "Thoughts on playing Civilization 6"
---

I played some Civilization 6 with someone today and it was not what I expected. I've played like a round before against bots and I have like 80 hours in Civilization 5, but having to build wide rather than deep was really hard, as was religion.

I'm going to try playing again in a day or so and see how that works out. Maybe I'll be much better!

I'm really thinking my daily blogs like these are better off in some sort of micro-blogging thing like Mastodon. But meh. Maybe I'll try my hand at looking at Mastodon / activitypub and have a "status" thing where I say what I learned that day? No clue.
